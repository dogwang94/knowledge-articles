### Introduction

The VA OIT DevOps Tools Team (DOTS), which currently manages the VA’s licensed Slack 
workspaces, is migrating Slack workspaces to the VA's Slack Enterprise Grid environment that is 
FedRAMP authorized and has an Authority to Operate (ATO) at the VA.  In addition to satisfying 
compliance requirements, VA's Slack Enterprise Grid enables collaboration across Slack 
workspaces eliminating the need to have access to multiple workspaces.  Similar to Outlook 
and Teams, all VA users will exist in an organizational level and can communicate with each 
other. 
 
Users in your workspace, for the most part, will not notice a difference once they migrate to the 
VA's Slack Enterprise Grid environment. The only significant change to the user experience is the 
requirement to sign in via Single Sign-On (SSO).  
 
We recognize that not every Slack user at the VA has the credentials to sign into the needed tools via VA’s 
SSO network. As such, the VA OIT DOTS Slack administrators can add users to the SSO exclusion list.  Once added to the list, this allows users to access their Slack workspace on the Slack 
Grid with a username/password + mandatory two-factor authentication. Being added to the exception list provides access to slack anywhere including personal devices, mobile phones and government furnished equipment. If you do not have a va.gov email address, you may [request to be added to SSO exception list](pages/exception).
 
Please email the VA's Slack Enterprise Grid Owner [Angela Gant-Curtis](Angela.Gant-Curtis@va.gov) for more information.
